        <h1>Welcome to my Final Project Page!!</h1> 
    <p>Hello!! Sophia and myself decided to make an educational app to teach children how to draw shapes.  We thought an educational <br>
    app wpuld demonstrate what we learned the best!! In order to work the app you have to press the start button.  After that you <br>
    select which shape you would like to learn how to draw.  Once you do that you choose which color you would like to draw with. <br>
    Then learn how to draw!! If you would like to choose a different color to draw in, there are three options for you!! Have fun!!</p>
